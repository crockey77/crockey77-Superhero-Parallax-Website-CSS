      <h2>The Night King</h2>
      <p>
        The Night King appears in a vision being observed by Bran and the
        Three-eyed Raven, where they witness him as a human being forcibly
        transformed into the first White Walker by the Children of the Forest by
        impaling him with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf
        about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war
        with the First Men and had no choice. Later on, Bran decides to observe
        a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of
        wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran
        awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven

        Bran and Meera Reed are able to escape.

      <h2>The Spiderman</h2>
      <p>
        Spider-Man is a fictional superhero in the Marvel Comics and the overall
        main protagonist of the Marvel Universe. He is a character created by
        writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing
        Fantasy #15 in August 1962. The premise was that he was an orphan being
        raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben as an ordinary teenager. He would
        deal with the normal struggles of being young as well as the struggles
        of being a costumed crime fighter. His powers were super strength,
        agility, the ability to cling to almost every surface, the ability to
        shoot spider-webs using a device that he invented which he calls
        "web-shooters," and reacting to danger quickly with his "spider-sense",
        enabling him to combat many foes similar to that of a spider.

      <h2>Walter White</h2>
      <p>
        Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is a
        fictional character and the protagonist of the American crime drama
        television series Breaking Bad. He is portrayed by Bryan Cranston. A
        chemist and graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Walter
        co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies. He left Gray Matter
        abruptly, selling his shares for $5,000. Soon afterward, the company
        made a fortune, much of it from Walt's research. Walt subsequently moved
        to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he became a high school chemistry
        teacher. On his 50th birthday, he is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung
        cancer. After this discovery, Walt resorts to manufacturing and selling
        methamphetamines with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to
        ensure his family's financial security after his death. He is pulled
        deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as
        the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which
        becomes recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade.
        Walt becomes less sympathetic throughout the show, as series creator
        Vince Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface".
